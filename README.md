# blog

This is a simple statically generated blog, built with Python, using mainly
https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown and
https://github.com/pallets/jinja

Would require some editing of the html templates to be re-usable

The UI is based on a Bootstrap template by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo) https://getbootstrap.com
